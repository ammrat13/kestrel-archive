-- Error msg: "Field opA must be fully specified (rrrrrr)" should read 
something more like what is in kasm96: "operand A must be a register"
or rather: "operand A is not defined"

-- Kasm96 thinks that opC must be a register when used in conjunction 
with opB (where opB specifies a register). This is not correct as far as
I know.
