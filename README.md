# Kestrel Archive

*Kestrel* is a SIMD linear array developed at UCSC in the late 1990s and early
2000s. This repository hosts code and documentation relating to the
architecture. In particular, it has an assembler and a simulator, as well as the
assembler's manual.

This code is old. For example, the code is known to not compile unmodified on
the latest version of `gcc`. Furthermore, there are known bugs in the simulator
--- both in the frontend and in the underlying logic. Nonetheless, the code is
provided here as I found it.

I obtained these materials in EE 382A at Stanford during Spring 2025. The
